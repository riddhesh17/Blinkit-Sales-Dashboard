- **Visualization**: Developed interactive dashboards using **Power BI**, which allows for visualizing sales trends, item preferences, and outlet performance with drill-through capabilities for deeper analysis.

## Technology Used
- **Power BI**: The primary tool for creating and visualizing dashboards. Power BI enables interactive data exploration, filtering, and real-time updates.

### Elements Used in Power BI for Visualization
- **Bar and Line Charts**: These charts effectively show sales trends over time and the comparative performance of various outlet types and regions.
- **Tables and Matrices**: Tables present the detailed sales breakdowns, making them ideal for comparison and drill-down analysis by stakeholders.
- **Slicers and Filters**: The flexibility to filter by outlet characteristics (e.g., type, size) and time periods (e.g., daily, monthly) ensures tailored analysis based on stakeholder needs.
- **Cards**: Essential for presenting high-level metrics at a glance, helping stakeholders quickly assess performance and focus on areas requiring attention.
- **Donut Charts**: These charts are particularly useful for displaying proportional data in a clear, visually appealing manner. They help in understanding how sales are distributed across various categories like fat content, outlet types, and regions, offering a quick snapshot of the data distribution.
